# Heleus Services

This repository contains all the service implementations for the Heleus Core apps. Services are always split into two parts, a "base" part that is also used on the client and contains definitions and shared code and the implementation that is loaded by the [Heleus.Node](https://github.com/HeleusCore/Heleus.Node). Please, do not clone this repository directly, clone https://github.com/HeleusCore/HeleusCore instead.
